A Minecraft Forge mod made for practice.

This adds a new sword and couple new items. You can smelt obsidian to make obsidian shards and combine those in a square of four to make a refined obsidian shard. Use two of those and a stick to make the sword as you would any other.

The sword is incredibly powerful, but only lasts for one hit.
